Array vs List:
    Array stores values
    List stores address of the Object

TreeSet -> binary tree
    see: app.a.treeset

TreeMap -> binary tree
    -sorted map according to keys
    see: app.a.treemap


Comparable & Comparator Interface

Generics
	- type check for methods and classes that consumes various types of objects
	- 

MultiThreading:
    - Thread Class
        = class that actually has start() and does the multithreading 
    - Runnable Interface
        = Thread class has to consume runnable before runnable can run multithreading
        = ex. Thread thread = new Thread(Runnable); thread.start();
    - run() vs start()
        = start() to run multithread

Lambda Functions:
    (annotation)@FunctionalInterface : annotation for lambda functions
        - Functional Interface must have only one abstract method

    syntax ex. AAA a = () -> {//TODO;};


IOstream: (for networking, down/upload, etc.)
    -바이트방식(InputStream, OutputStream)
    -문자방식(Reader, Writer)
